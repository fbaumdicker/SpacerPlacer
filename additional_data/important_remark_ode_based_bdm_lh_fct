If error occurs when using ode_based likelihood function, it is possible that the lambdified function is not up to date.
Lambdification is needed so that numpy can work with the symbolic function (generated with sympy).
Lambdification of the bdm_lh_fct function is heavily dependent on the version of numpy and sympy. Thus it needs to be
tested and relambdified for new numpy/sympy versions.
Just run sp_model/bdm_likelihood_computation/symbolic_lh_computation.py as standalone script
(in your spacerplacer environment).
This should replace the lambdifyed version provided in the github repository with a new one.

Might set this up as part of installation process in the future.
